# LLVMGraphs
LLVM CDG &amp; CFG for three different programs: sumoriginal.c, sum3.c, smallcode.c

## Source Code

Source Code folder contains sum3.c, smallcode.c and sumoriginal.c. To view the source code you can clone the repository and use your favorite text editor. Every program has a corresponding Control Flow Graph and Control Dependence Graph output in LLVM IR code. A hopeful addition to this repo is that I will find a way to output the code as the original source code instead of the LLVM IR code.

## Usage

Each folder contains control flow graphs and control dependence graphs for the three different programs, as a png and as a dot file. To run the dot files you can use commands like xdot, and to see the png you can clone the repository and open it.
